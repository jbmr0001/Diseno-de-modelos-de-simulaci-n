Define equivalent circuit parameters

tau1 = 40;
R1 = .005;
C1 = tau1/R1;
R0 = 0.01;

Calculate continuous and discrete state-space matrices

% A = -1/tau1;
% B = 1/C1;
% C = -1;
% D = -R0;
% 
% sys = ss(A,B,C,D)
% 
% Ts = 0.1;
% sysd = c2d(sys,Ts)

% sim(gcs)

Write the equivalent circuit as a continuous time transfer function


a_c = R0 * tau1;
b_c = R0 + R1;
c_c = tau1;
d_c = 1;
sys = tf([a_c,b_c],[c_c,d_c])

Discretize with sampling time Ts

Ts = 1e-1;
sysd = c2d(sys,Ts)
temp1 = sysd.Numerator{1};
temp2 = sysd.Denominator{1};
a = temp1(1)
b = temp1(2)
c = temp2(1)
d = temp2(2)

Find inverse Laplace transform of the first order TF to find analytical discrete equivalent

The transfer function of an equivalent circuit with one time constant is

Let's for now simplify this correcting for OCV and call the three tf variables a, b, c, let's calculate the inverse Laplace transform of 


syms s t a b c h
F = (a*s+b)/(c*s+1)/s
HiL = ilaplace(F,s,t)

Now, let's calculate the z-transform of


syms Ts k z
H = (1-1/z)*ztrans(b+(a-b*c)/c*exp(-k*Ts/c),k,z)

syms R0 R1 C1
simplify(subs(H,[a,b,c],[R0*R1*C1,R0+R1,R1*C1]))
